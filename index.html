  <h3>Here's a time line of Elon Musk's life:</h3>
  <article>
    <li><b>1971</b> - Born in Pretoria, South Africa</li>
    <li><b>1995</b> - Musk, Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company Zip2 with funds from angel investors.</li>
    <li><b>1997</b> - He graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physics.</li>
    <li><b>1999</b> - Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company</li>
    <li><b>2001</b>- Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society. He was inspired by plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars and discussed funding the project himself.
                      In October 2001, Musk traveled to Moscow to buy refurbished Intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. 
                      He met with companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice and was even spat on by one of the Russian chief designers. 
                      The group returned to the United States empty-handed. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. 
                      They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. Musk instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.
                        With $100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., traded as SpaceX, in May 2002.</li>
    <li><b>2003</b> - Tesla, Inc.—originally Tesla Motors—was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, who financed the company until the Series A round of funding.
                      Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement. Musk led the Series A round of investment in 2004, joining Tesla's board of directors as chairman.
                      Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.</li>
